# Warm-lane experiment tools

Use `check-plan` to admit every selected fault before lane work; the
[fault observation tools](../faults/README.md) describe its independent probes.
`preflight` checks the host and frozen images. `run` owns incident injection,
native learning, independent grading and fenced recovery. `sequence` adds a
restartable journal for adjacent first/exact-repeat pairs with private lane memory.

## Change the application without recreating kind

`up --no-dev-mount --reuse-cluster-only` attaches using the existing lane's
`KUBECONFIG`. Missing cluster, kubeconfig or incompatible node topology stops the
operation; this mode never falls back to cluster creation.

`retire-app` combines a bounded old-app retirement with attach-only deployment:

```bash
uv run python -m benchmarks.sregym.fastloop retire-app \
  --run-dir OLD_ENVIRONMENT --next-run-dir NEW_ENVIRONMENT \
  --next-namespace social-network --next-problem SOCIAL_PROBLEM_ID \
  --seed FRESH_SOCIAL_SOURCE --lease LANE_LEASE --coord COORD_COMMAND \
  --controller-image CONTROLLER --responder-image RESPONDER --validator-image VALIDATOR
```

It checks the current lane lease before writes, refuses unfinished native closure
or workers, pauses an idle native controller, deletes only the old application
namespace and its SDO namespace, and waits for both to disappear. The new app is
deployed on the same cluster and kubeconfig through attach-only `up`. Completion
requires the ordinary `lane_resources` check for the new app. The next environment
retains intent and completion receipts; a partial retirement can be retried with
the same fixed target set. The command never removes infrastructure or unrelated
namespaces. New-app model credentials must be provisioned through the experiment's
existing credential helper; retirement does not read or copy credential data.
